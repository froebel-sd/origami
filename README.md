# origami

this repository is intended to host origami, a package manager and build orchestrator tool intended for 
future releases of [froebel](https://github.com/froebel-sd/froebel).

origami is to be written in lua, as a tool to automatically build packages and their dependencies from simple specfiles,
as well as full system images.

more on this later.
